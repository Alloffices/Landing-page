              <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have given your clear consent to the processing of your personal data for a specific purpose.</span></li>
              <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party (or for us to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract with you).</span></li>
              <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Processing is necessary for our compliance with the law.</span></li>
              <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Processing is necessary to protect someone&#8217;s life.</span></li>
              <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Processing is necessary for us to perform a task in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority and the task/function has a clear basis in law.</span></li>
              <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Processing is necessary for our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of a third party, except where there is a good reason to protect your personal data which overrides those legitimate interests, such as:</span>
                <ul>
                  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">allowing us to effectively and efficiently manage and administer the operation of our business;</span></li>

                  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">offering optimal, up-to-date security solutions for mobile devices and IT systems; and</span></li>
                  <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">obtaining further knowledge of current threats to network security in order to update our security solutions and provide these to the market. </span></li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 500;">6.2 Data Subject Rights</span></p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the GDPR, you have the right to:</span></p>
            <h4></h4>
            <ul>
              <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Withdraw your consent to the processing of your personal data at any time. Please note, however, that we may still be entitled to process your personal data if we have another legitimate reason for doing so (such as to comply with a legal obligation).</span></li>
              <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be informed of what data we hold and the purpose for processing the data, as a whole or in parts.</span></li>
              <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be forgotten and, in some circumstances, have your data erased by ourselves and our affiliates (although this is not an absolute right and there may be circumstances where you ask us to erase your personal data but we are legally entitled to retain it).</span></li>
              <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Correct or supplement any information we hold about you that is incorrect or incomplete.</span></li>
              <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Restrict processing of the information we hold about you (for example, so that inaccuracies may be corrected but again, there may be circumstances where you ask us to restrict processing of your personal data but we are legally entitled to refuse that request).</span></li>
              <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Object to the processing of your data.</span></li>

(We would, however, appreciate the chance to address your concerns, so please contact us prior to taking this step).</span></li>
            </ul>
            <h4></h4>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights) unless your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances. </span></p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes.
